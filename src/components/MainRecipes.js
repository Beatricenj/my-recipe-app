          <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1kg all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp milk powder</li>
            <li>3 cups water (room temperature)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp ghee</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, add flour, salt, sugar, milk powder and baking powder. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour water little by little and mix. Start with 2 cups of water. Add remaining accordingly. Mix well until everything comes together. If the dough is too sticky, add little flour. It should be soft and not very hard. Rub with oil and let it rest covered for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add oil and knead well for about 5-10 minutes. The dough should be soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Oil it, cover and let it rest for one hour</li>
            <li>Make medium or small sized balls. With small balls I got 20 parathas. Usually Pakistani parathas are very big.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together 2 tbsp flour and ghee and make a paste.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough and spread the ghee paste all over it.</li>
            <li>Fold it in half and spread the ghee paste on top.</li>
            <li>Twirl the dough like a rose</li>
            <li>Press it down and repeat the same with all the other dough balls</li>
            <li>Roll out each dough balls into a medium thin paratha.</li>
            <li>Place it on a medium hot tawa or pan. The flame should be at medium high.</li>
            <li>Apply ghee on both sides and cook until there are golden brown spots on both sides of the paratha.</li>
            <li>After cooking 3-4 parathas, while it is still hot, stack them one on top of the other and crush the parathas to see the layers more clearly. This is not required, but I like to do it.</li>
            <li>Stack them one on top of the other to keep them soft in a hot pan.</li>
